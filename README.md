# Xutim ("Shoo-teem")

A modular CMS system built with Symfony 7.3, Doctrine ORM, Turbo/Stimulus, and Editor.js.

> **Warning**: This project is in active development and is **not yet stable**. While it powers production websites, the API, database schema, and bundle interfaces may change significantly without prior notice. Use at your own risk.

## Status

Xutim is used in production already, but it is pre-alpha software. There are no stability guarantees, no migration guides between versions, and breaking changes are expected.

**What this means:**

- The codebase works but is evolving rapidly
- Documentation is minimal
- No semantic versioning until a stable release
- Contributions are welcome, but expect volatility

## Overview

This is a **monorepo for bundle development**, not a standalone application.
